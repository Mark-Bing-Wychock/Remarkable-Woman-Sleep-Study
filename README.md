# A Remarkable Woman's Sleep Journey

How did you sleep last night?  Did you feel rested when you woke up?  Did you ever wonder why?  These questions are the core of this sleep study.  My wife is a wonderful and amazing woman.  Lively, intelligent, and head strong.  She's however one of many who suffers from a myriad of sleep issues.  Often waking up in the middle of the night, having trouble trouble falling asleep, and not feeling rested when she wakes up.  These issues can often result in chronic fatigue, mood swings, and lack of coordination.  We would often argue about why she was having sleep issues: (whether it was bed time, the fact that she napped, etc.) However, when my wife almost fell hitting her head on a nearby counter after a few consecutive nights of poor sleep, something had to be done.  

At the time, I was Data Analyst at meat processing and distribution company and was working on my Google Data Analyst certification and realized I could perform a sleep study and use the data to find out why she was having issues with her sleep. Hence, I present and ongoing study of sleep patterns and behaviors of a remarkable woman.  Data is collected periodically through Google Forms and from the ZEPP app and stored on Google Sheets. This data is then processed and linked to a live Google Looker dashboard.

### Data Types:

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

**In Progress:**
* (50% Completion) - Feature engineer bedtime variables and link to visualizations on dashboard to compare with rested vs. not rested variables.
* (40% Completion) - Develop and deploy decision tree based machine learning models (MLM) with Python to discover additional insights.

**Planned**
* Transform and feature engineer continuous data into categorical and use Apriori Algorithms via Python to discover insights between different variables.
* Link MLM model results to live dashboard and have it auto update when new data is periodically added.
* Utilize APIs to automatically update static dashboard .csv files.
